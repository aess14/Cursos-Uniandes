# Machine Learning

##By Input or Signal:

###Supervised Learning:
- Example Input/ Desired Output. Goal: Maps input->output.
###Unsupervised Learning:
- No labels to the learning algorithm. It finds its own input.
###Semi-supervised learning:
-Teacher gives an incomplete signal (for the goal), target outputs missing.
###Reinforcement Learning:
- Dynamic environment to perform a certain goal (aka. driving a vehicle).

##By output:

###Classification:
- Inputs into 2 or more classes. Learner produces a model that assigns input to these classes. Usually supervised. Ex: Spam Filtering.
###Regression:
- Supervised. Continuous outputs.
###Clustering:
- Outputs divided into groups, which are not known beforehand (unsupervised).
###Density Estimation:
- Distribution in space.
###Dimensionality Reduction:
-  Mapping variables into a lower dimensional space. MDS, PCA. Topic Modeling: Finding common topics in texts.
